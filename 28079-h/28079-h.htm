<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>I was invited the other day to take down, as Stenographer, what
purported to be a discussion upon some general political topics, and
more especially on the forthcoming presidential election. One of the
disputants entrenched himself in what, I believe, scholars call the
Socratic method, that is, he <i>pumped</i> his supposed antagonist dry.
Whether the world at large may think the dialogue as funny as I did
myself, I can form no opinion. It is to solve this question that I give
it to the public.</p>

<h2>THE DIALOGUE.</h2>

<p>What is a republic?</p>

<p>&mdash;A state, or Union of states, in which the people holds supreme power.</p>

<p>How does the people exercise this power?</p>

<p>&mdash;Through men elected for this purpose.</p>

<p>What are these men called?</p>

<p>&mdash;Senators and members of Congress or Congressmen.</p>

<p>Is there a head or chief in a republic?</p>

<p>&mdash;Certainly.</p>

<p>What is he called?</p>

<p>&mdash;The President.</p>

<p>Must the President be elected?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, by the people.</p>

<p>Who declares the voice of the people in this matter?</p>

<p>&mdash;The electors of the different states, appointed to do it by the
people.</p>

<p>Is it necessary that the whole people should agree on one man in order
to elect him?</p>

<p>&mdash;No; it only needs a majority of the nation, voting through the
electors.</p>

<p>Do the votes of the electors generally follow the voice of the people in
the different states?</p>

<p>&mdash;They ought to follow it.</p>

<p>Are the electors considered bound to vote as the majority of the people
in their different states direct?</p>

<p>&mdash;Undoubtedly they are.</p>

<p>Then it is fair to say that the vote of a majority of the electors show
which way the majority of the people voted?</p>

<p>&mdash;That's a simple question. Why, of course!</p>

<p>What are the duties of the President?</p>

<p>&mdash;To mind the business of the nation, and his own, too.</p>

<p>Anything else?</p>

<p><!-- Page 4 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>

&mdash;Isn't that enough?</p>

<p>Well, but what is that business?</p>

<p>&mdash;The business of the nation?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>&mdash;He makes treaties, weeds out old political hacks, and sends them on
embassies where they cannot annoy him, and have nothing to do; appoints
Judges of the Supreme Court like Joe Bradley, when he wants to play
eight-to-seven, commands the army and navy, gets fifty thousand dollars
a year, takes all the presents he can get, lives in the White House, and
does a kind of general housekeeping business for the country.</p>

<p>I was not talking of Grant. Let that go. Does he do anything else?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes; if he comes from Ohio, he fills nearly every place he's got to
give away with lean, hungry Ohio men, so that you can get a "whiff" of
that state all over Washington, and in a good many other places too, any
time of the day or night.</p>

<p>Really I don't understand you. All our Presidents do not come from Ohio
or Illinois!</p>

<p>&mdash;Thank God they don't.</p>

<p>Just tell me what the Senators have to do?</p>

<p>&mdash;To prevent Congressmen from making fools of themselves.</p>

<p>Anything else?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes; to keep an eye on the "jobs" Congressmen are always trying to put
through.</p>

<p>What are the duties of Congressmen?</p>

<p>&mdash;God knows! I don't think they do themselves.</p>

<p>What should you think?</p>

<p>&mdash;From the way they go on, I should say: to make a grab whenever they
can.</p>

<p>Who is now President of the United States?</p>

<p>&mdash;Samuel&nbsp;J. Tilden.</p>

<p>That is a mistake. The present President of the United States is
Rutherford&nbsp;B. Hayes.</p>

<p>&mdash;He is, is he? Yes, just about as much as I'm owner of Central Park,
when I sit down on a bench there.</p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p><!-- Page 5 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>

&mdash;I mean to say a man can't be President of this country unless he is
elected, and Hayes was never elected.</p>

<p>Who was elected then?</p>

<p>&mdash;Why, Samuel&nbsp;J. Tilden, to be sure!</p>

<p>Then how did Hayes get in?</p>

<p>&mdash;He had some "statesmen" working for him, who kept the right man out
and pushed him in.</p>

<p>Do you really mean that?</p>

<p>&mdash;As certain as death.</p>

<p>Very strange! Who were these "statesmen;" I suppose you mean his
friends?</p>

<p>&mdash;Friends, indeed! Yes, like wolves are to sheep.</p>

<p>Is Mr.&nbsp;Hayes a sheep?</p>

<p>&mdash;The people that put him where he is, have made him sheepish enough;
but he isn't a sheep. His hide is too thick for that. He would be a
mule, <i>only he isn't quite big enough</i>.</p>

<p>Ah! You have a strange way of expressing yourself. But tell me, who were
his "friends" as you call them?</p>

<p>&mdash;The same men that "worked" Grant.</p>

<p>What do you mean by "working" Grant?</p>

<p>&mdash;Putting a pair of "blinkers" on him, and then stealing everything they
could lay their hands on; and then when they were going to be turned
out, stealing the presidency so as to get another "hack" at the "swag."</p>

<p>Really, this language sounds dreadful, I don't understand it; but I
suppose you mean right.</p>

<p>&mdash;Mean right? I should think I do. I <i>am</i> right. Only in talking of
thieves, I am using the language of thieves. They simply wanted to keep
their places and go on plundering the people.</p>

<p>Speaking about General Grant, what kind of a President was he?</p>

<p>&mdash;The best judge of whiskey, cigars and horses that ever stepped into
the White House.</p>

<p>Heavens! how dull you are! I'm not talking about whiskey and cigars, I
mean what were his gifts?</p>

<p><!-- Page 6 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>

&mdash;Gifts? to whom? I never heard that he made any gifts. He took
everything offered him from a brownstone front downwards, until it got
to a bull-pup with the expressage unpaid&mdash;there he stopped.</p>

<p>Shall I ever get you to understand me? I mean had he any good qualities?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes; he had. He wore a padlock on his mouth, was a rattling fighter,
and stuck to his friends. In fact, he was generally bull-headed, <i>as it
were</i>.</p>

<p>Good enough! But these are not the qualities I am speaking of. I mean
qualities that the people look for in a President. Perhaps "sticking to
his friends" may have been one. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>&mdash;What do I mean? Why, screening and protecting a set of rascals not
half as honest as nine-tenths of the men in jail for robbery.</p>

<p>Do you mean me to understand by screening that he did what they do with
coal, sift out the little ones and keep in the big ones?</p>

<p>&mdash;Not at all. There was no "sift" to Grant; he stuck to the whole lot
until the Republican party told him he must either let them go or lose
the country.</p>

<p>By the way, are the Republicans good people?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes; just as good as any other, and a good deal better, if they were
only Democrats.</p>

<p>Why do you complain of them, then?</p>

<p>&mdash;I don't complain of the honest Republican people of the country. I
complain of the Republican politicians.</p>

<p>What is a "politician?"</p>

<p>&mdash;Sometimes an honest man like John Morrissey; hardly ever a fool;
generally a knave.</p>

<p>What do you mean by a political party?</p>

<p>&mdash;The term has two meanings. First, all the honest people of the country
who believe in a given set of political principles. Secondly, it means
all the political office-holders, <i>managers</i> and wire-pullers, whose
business is to throw dust in the eyes of the non-politicians (<i>i. e.</i>,
the simple voters).</p>

<p><!-- Page 7 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>

<i>In this latter sense</i> how many parties are there?</p>

<p>&mdash;A good many people think there is only one.</p>

<p>To what party does Mr.&nbsp;Hayes belong?</p>

<p>&mdash;To the Orange party.</p>

<p>What is that?</p>

<p>&mdash;The temperance party that takes its rum in iced oranges.</p>

<p>Is he an able man?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes; able to take a kicking from the Republicans better than any other
man in the country.</p>

<p>What do you mean by taking a kicking?</p>

<p>&mdash;Why, accepting the toe of the political boot.</p>

<p>Can you name any one who has operated on him in this delicate manner?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes; Roscoe Conkling.</p>

<p>Would you call <i>him</i> a good kicker or bootist?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes; tip-top.</p>

<p>What proof have you of this?</p>

<p>&mdash;When Hayes and Sherman kicked Cornell out of office, Roscoe kicked him
back on them as governor of the state of New York. When they kicked
Arthur out of the custom-house, Roscoe kicked him into the second place
on the Republican ticket.</p>

<p>Any further proof?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes; he kicked Evarts to New York to talk for Cornell, whom, as before
said, the administration kicked out. John Sherman was afraid of his toe
when he spoke lately at Washington <i>in favor</i> of the man whom he forced
the President to kick out, saying he was unfit for the office he held.
At last it looks as if Roscoe was going to kick himself into talking for
Garfield, whom he despises.</p>

<p>Why should he do that?</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh! it's only the "machine" working.</p>

<p>I don't understand.</p>

<p>&mdash;Have you ever seen a bull trying to stop a locomotive?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, if ever you do, you'll see something like a politician

<!-- Page 8 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>

trying to butt against the "party," <i>alias</i> the "machine."</p>

<p>Then is the great bootist afraid of the "machine?"</p>

<p>&mdash;I don't think he's afraid of anything. But he knows there's no use
kicking against <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>By the way, you said Hayes had been put into office without being
elected, had Conkling anything to do with that?</p>

<p>&mdash;No. He's too proud a man to stoop to any dirty work. He has held
Hayes' administration at arm's length, and never gone near them except
when he was on the "kick."</p>

<p>Then who did put Hayes into office?</p>

<p>&mdash;There were a good many in the job. Thirty-three in Florida and
seventy-two in Louisiana; Garfield and John Sherman, chief "engineers."</p>

<p>Do you mean to say that the man nominated by the Republicans for
President, and the Secretary of the Treasury countenanced the men who
forced Hayes on the country?</p>

<p>&mdash;If not, why were rewards promised the rascals for doing it? When the
job was done, and Hayes inaugurated, every one of the scoundrels was
"provided for."</p>

<p>Didn't the other party protest?</p>

<p>&mdash;Of course they did. But it was the old story of the fly and spider.</p>

<p>In what way?</p>

<p>&mdash;The 'Pubs got the 'Crats to consent to have the difficulty settled by
an Electoral Commission and then euchred them.</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>&mdash;Simple enough. There were eight 'Pubs on the Commission and seven
'Crats. They met. Up gets old Evarts. Says he to the Commissioners:
"Boys"&mdash;I mean&mdash;"Gentlemen! The first duty of a Judge, if he wants very
badly to find the 'cat in the bag,' is to look up the chimney." Here he
winked at the Judges on Joe Bradley's side. They say he looked very much
like Beecher, when he proved his innocence in Brooklyn.

<!-- Page 9 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>

"Therefore," says he, "if the involutionary concatenation of a political residuum
approximates to the concordant volitions of a Republican effervescence,
it is extra self-evident that judicial investigation into supernumerary
circumstantial totality, is beyond the hypodermic flexal radiation of
your illustrations." The argument was short, but it settled the case!</p>

<p>But I don't understand a word of it.</p>

<p>&mdash;What does that matter? He didn't himself. But they voted on the
question all the same.</p>

<p>How did the vote go?</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, that <i>is</i> a simple question! Why eight to seven, to be sure!
What he said was supposed to mean they had no right to take evidence.
The 'Pubs agreed with him. They said they were there to do nothing, and
intended to do it, and pay attention to it. They were eight. And they
voted eight&mdash;eight, eight, eight, eight&mdash;every time.</p>

<p>Well, but what had Garfield particularly to do with this?</p>

<p>&mdash;First of all he said in Congress: "The Commission is clothed with
power to hear and determine the vote of any state." *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;He declared on
his honor (!) that the Commission had power to go down into the states
and <i>review</i> the act of every officer, to <i>open every ballot box</i>, and
to pass judgment on <i>every ballot</i> cast by seven millions of Americans.
He said they had all the powers of the Senate and House of
Representatives to examine into everything.</p>

<p>And then?</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, then, as he was playing euchre, he popped the "joker" (himself)
on the 'Crats' left bower, and voted the Commission had no right to do
anything of the sort. In the next game the "<i>joker</i>" will be discarded.</p>

<p>How about the 'Crats, as you call them?</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, as they were only seven, and couldn't be in two places at once,
and vote fourteen, they threw up their hand.</p>

<p>Why, this was simply a farce?</p>

<p>&mdash;That's so; but it's very curious the people that were watching the
farce didn't see anything funny about it,

<!-- Page 10 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>

or laugh. They were quiet&mdash;very quiet. I think they had a notion the tragedy would come
later, and then they'd change the <i>cast</i>, and take a hand in themselves,
just to see how it would go.</p>

<p>Please, explain yourself?</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, during the farce, the Electoral Commission, Garfield being one,
were the actors, and the people were the spectators. During the tragedy
the people will be the actors, and Garfield, the Electoral Commission,
and the "machine" politicians will be the spectators&mdash;a very <i>select</i>
audience. Admission free. The stage will be rather large, about the size
of the United States. Lots of room for the audience. After the play
there will be a procession to the White House in Washington. The actors
will invite their special friends to it. I don't think Garfield, the
Electoral Commission, or the Republican "machine" engineers, will get
cards of invitation. They will, perhaps, be asked to a free lunch in
Ohio.</p>

<p>Now for the application.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, you must remember the American people are not born idiots. They
saw through the whole of this Electoral Commission business, and they
kept quiet. They were enraged, however, to think these politicians could
imagine them so dead daft. I think, too, at one time they were within an
ace of letting themselves out. If they had, there would have been bad
work!</p>

<p>They did better to wait.</p>

<p>&mdash;To be sure; but what kills one is to see these same wire-pullers
putting up a man like Garfield for President. Why, he's got the
rottenest record of the whole lot. You hear them say he's a statesman.
Yes, indeed! and I'm Sultan of Turkey. He's nothing more than a common
political hack, and an unsafe one at that.</p>

<p>How so?</p>

<p>&mdash;<i>His own party</i> convicted him of bribe-taking, after he had sworn he
did nothing of the sort; many newspapers, on his own side, wanted him
expelled from the House. Heaven knows what the <i>hidden</i> doings of a man
like that are. The samples that have come to light are the worst
possible. To wind up with, he went

<!-- Page 11 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>

to Chicago expressly to look after
John Sherman's interests for the nomination, and then sold him clean
out, boots, hat and all! No wonder he said: "My God, what will John
Sherman say?"</p>

<p>And what did Sherman say?</p>

<p>&mdash;The "machine" put the screw on, and <i>honest</i> John Sherman had to say
he was the best man in the country to make President.</p>

<p>Did the audience notice any swelling in John's throat?</p>

<p>&mdash;No; but he got a bad attack of the hiccoughs soon after.</p>

<p>Stomach too full, I suppose?</p>

<p>&mdash;Exactly. John would have liked to <i>throw up</i> Garfield, but the
"machine" forced John to keep him on his stomach. That's what was the
matter.</p>

<p>Well, but after all, Garfield served his country?</p>

<p>&mdash;He did, served her a good many dirty tricks.</p>

<p>That's not what I mean. Didn't he serve in the army?</p>

<p>&mdash;What army?</p>

<p>The regular army.</p>

<p>&mdash;Do you mean to insult that splendid set of officers?</p>

<p>No, I'm serious.</p>

<p>&mdash;He was a volunteer colonel for about a year, and then slipped into
Congress when Hayes said any man that did so ought to be <i>scalped</i>.
Hayes deserves one for that, anyhow.</p>

<p>Can you mention any "hot affairs" in which he was engaged?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes; he led the "left" wing of the Credit Mobilier brigade in the raid
on the Treasury, under Oakes Ames, was desperately wounded and received
honorable mention from Schuyler Colfax, since dismissed the service. He
headed the "forlorn hope" in the attack on the Washington pavements. Was
again badly wounded; this time in the&mdash;no, I mean, <i>from</i> behind by his
own men. In this attack a <i>private</i> named de Golyer used a $5,000 dollar
bill for wadding, which was found when the wound was probed. This wound
is still open, as well as the first, and both give the <i>daring partisan</i>
constant and dreadful annoyance.</p>

<p>What <i>great</i> services to the country! Go on, please.</p>

<p>&mdash;He was conspicuous in many other engagements. He covered the advance
of the Salary and Back Pay Brigade

<!-- Page 12 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>

in another fierce assault on the
Treasury. Here he was so desperately wounded that his friends insisted
on his resigning and nursing his&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;character. He refused, and his
fellow soldiers have nominated him to supersede General Hayes as
Commander-in-Chief of the "Silent Steelers."</p>

<p>You mean, of course, troops that charge without cheering?</p>

<p>&mdash;Not much! I mean a corps of "crack"(s)men. They are also called the
"Stealthy Purloiners."</p>

<p>Can you mention any instances of Garfield's heroism?</p>

<p>&mdash;Loads! but one will be enough. A notorious freshwater buccaneer, named
R-be-s-n, had joined the ranks. He was just falling into the hands of
the enemy when Garfield seized him by the seat of his pants and the
collar of his jacket, and dragged him back into the lines. The sight was
too much for the enemy. They grounded arms and laughed outright. Two or
three of the men, however, "potted" the heroic Garfield; he was again
wounded just to the right of the end of the spinal column!</p>

<p>Please give me one more instance?</p>

<p>&mdash;He held the Black Friday bridge against the assault of the banking and
currency column. (Committee.) He reduced the enemy at one blow from
25,000 to&nbsp;250.</p>

<p>Good gracious! How? With a sword-stroke?</p>

<p>&mdash;No! with a lead pencil!</p>

<p>Do you mean he annihilated 20,000 men?</p>

<p>&mdash;No! dollars!</p>

<p>Explain, if you please.</p>

<p>&mdash;Certainly. Some one high up&mdash;very high up&mdash;stood in to the tune of
$25,000 in the Fisk and Gould arrangement when they made a "corner" in
gold. The money was sent by express. The manager of the express company
assured the committee, there was no such entry in the book to Mrs.&nbsp;G&mdash;&mdash;.
Sunset Cox astonished them with some of his "reflected" light. He
asked for the book and read out: Mrs.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;G., Wh&mdash;te Ho&mdash;se, money
package, value $25,000.</p>

<p>Dear me!</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, and dear me, too! Wait a minute! Up jumps <i>Mentor</i> Garfield and
says: It's only a slight mistake&mdash;evidently a mistake&mdash;the dot ought to
be removed one figure to the right, thus $250.00. Presto! Gentlemen! Two

hundred and fifty dollars you see, instead of twenty-five thousand.
His pals remembered this, especially Grant, and he turned him loose on
the Democratic majorities in Louisiana to do the same work.</p>

<p>He must be the very devil at figures.</p>

<p>&mdash;Just so; but that was <i>wiping out</i> a majority in both cases. In
November he'll have to try his hand at figuring up a majority where it
doesn't exist. Some difference between the two [ahem!] some <i>slight</i>
difference.</p>

<p>I suppose you allude to the election?</p>

<p>&mdash;Pre ... cisely!</p>

<p>What is Mr.&nbsp;Garfield doing now?</p>

<p>&mdash;Playing the cat.</p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p>&mdash;Trying to cover up the record behind him.</p>

<p>I don't see the allusion?</p>

<p>&mdash;That kind of allusion is seen through the <i>nose</i>.</p>

<p>Do you think this would be a <i>safe</i> country in Mr.&nbsp;Garfield's hands?</p>

<p>&mdash;What a question! Isn't he a "Jimmy"?</p>

<p>You mean a "tool" in the hands of the 'Pubs?</p>

<p>&mdash;You've hit it.</p>

<p>And they are going to make him President?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes; President of the Salt River Navigation and Improvement Company,
unlimited.</p>

<p>I thought they were going to make him President of the United States?</p>

<p>&mdash;I think they might if there wasn't some one else in the way.</p>

<p>Who's that?</p>

<p>&mdash;Hancock.</p>

<p>The man that signed the Declaration?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes; the Declaration of Gettysburg.</p>

<p>What is he?</p>

<p>&mdash;A real gentleman.</p>

<p>What else?</p>

<p>&mdash;A great soldier.</p>

<p>Anything more?</p>

<p>&mdash;A true citizen.</p>

<p>He must be a <i>singular</i> man?</p>

<p>&mdash;He is; there are not <i>two</i> like him in the country.</p>

<p>I should like to see him.</p>

<p><!-- Page 14 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>

&mdash;Nothing easier. He's big enough. Just <i>walk</i> over to Governor's
Island.</p>

<p>How can you prove he's a gentleman?</p>

<p>&mdash;He's an officer of the United States army.</p>

<p>Quite sufficient. Tell me why he's a great soldier.</p>

<p>&mdash;He saved the Union in battle.</p>

<p>I thought Grant did that?</p>

<p>&mdash;Grant did first-rate fighting; but if Hancock hadn't won at
Gettysburg, Grant and his army might as well have sat down where they
were and gone into the "Tanner" business.</p>

<p>Did he take a part in any other great battles?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes; in nearly every battle fought by the army of the Potomac until he
was carried off the field at Gettysburg.</p>

<p>What did the country think of him?</p>

<p>&mdash;Everything that could be thought of a brave, noble nature.</p>

<p>What did Congress do?</p>

<p>&mdash;Passed a special vote of thanks to him for his conspicuous part in the
battle that saved the country.</p>

<p>Of course they passed a vote of thanks to Garfield, too?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes; a <i>silent</i> vote.</p>

<p>How do you prove that Hancock is a true citizen?</p>

<p>&mdash;Because he has profound respect for the laws and constitution of his
country.</p>

<p>When did he show this?</p>

<p>&mdash;He has shown it all his life.</p>

<p>But more particularly?</p>

<p>&mdash;When the war was over he put up his sword. Grant, Garfield&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Co.
insisted he should rule with it. He refused. He told the trembling
Southern people they had the same rights <i>in peace</i> as all other
American citizens, and that he would make his army protect those rights.</p>

<p>What are those rights?</p>

<p>&mdash;Trial by jury, <i>habeas corpus</i>, free speech and free press.</p>

<p>Did he put that down in writing?</p>

<p>&mdash;I should think he did. He wrote a letter to old Pease, the governor of
Texas, that must have flashed into him like lightning into a gooseberry
bush.</p>

<p>Did he write anything else?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes; the great Order No. 40.</p>

<p>I remember that. What did Andy Johnson say about it?</p>

<p><!-- Page 15 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>

&mdash;He said: "When a great soldier, with unrestricted power in his hands
to oppress his fellow-men, voluntarily foregoes the chance of gratifying
selfish ambition, and devotes himself to building up the liberties and
strengthening the laws of his country, he presents an example of the
highest public virtue that human nature is capable of practising.
Whenever power <i>above</i> the law courted his acceptance, he calmly put the
temptation aside. By such magnanimous acts of forbearance he won the
universal admiration of mankind, and left a name which has no rival in
the history of the world."</p>

<p>Did he say anything else?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes. He said: "I respectfully suggest to Congress that some public
recognition of General Hancock's <i>patriotic</i> conduct is due, if not to
him, to the friends of law and justice throughout the country. Of such
an act as his, at such a time, it is but fit that the dignity should be
vindicated and the virtue proclaimed, so that its value as an example
may not be lost to the nation."</p>

<p>Did Congress do anything?</p>

<p>&mdash;Never mind Congress. The American people will do it in November by
putting him where George Washington was, so that the whole world may
take a good, long look at him. It's impossible to knock the modesty out
of him, so we'll take it with him, and put it "<i>where it will do the
most good</i>."</p>

<p>Of course, Garfield felt just like Andy Johnson in this matter?</p>

<p>&mdash;Quite so.</p>

<p>How did he show it?</p>

<p>&mdash;By bringing a bill into Congress to <i>dismiss</i> General Hancock from the
army for insisting on all the rights of citizens <i>in time of peace</i>.</p>

<p>Good heavens!</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, good heavens! I should say so. That wasn't the worst part of it.
He wanted the bill voted on the <i>next</i> day. And the act provided that it
should <i>take effect as soon as it was passed</i>. So that, if General
Hancock had nothing outside his pay, this soldier (?) who ran away from
the field to go "jobbing" in Congress, would the <i>next day</i> have made a
beggar of the man who really saved the Union!</p>

<p><!-- Page 16 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>

Do you think good, honest Republican voters (I don't mean the "machine"
men), know or remember anything about it?</p>

<p>&mdash;We live so fast that I expect many of them have let it drop out of
their minds. <i>But now's the time for them to remember it.</i></p>

<p>Has General Hancock shown how he can deal with trying difficulties since
the war?</p>

<p>&mdash;I should rather think so. Do you remember when they had the terrible
riots in Pennsylvania, and so much property was destroyed and so many
lives lost in and about Pittsburgh? Well, the very men who to-day are
talking up Garfield and running down Hancock, were shaking in their
shoes; Schurz, <i>whom Hancock caught trying to make himself invisible at
Gettysburg</i>, among them. It was a regular Quakers' meeting. Finding
they could make no head against it, and that the thing was spreading and
getting to look like a revolution, what did they do? Why, they sent for
the man whom Garfield wanted to beggar and disgrace, and besought him to
take the thing in hand and restore order. They gave him full power.</p>

<p>And how did he act?</p>

<p>&mdash;Like a brave soldier, a true citizen and a real gentleman. While
protecting the property of capitalists he was kind and forbearing to the
working classes who believed they had a grievance.</p>

<p>What was the result?</p>

<p>&mdash;That dreadful affair was brought to a close by him without the
shedding of one single drop of blood. Before he took command many had
lost their lives. He put down the riot so firmly but so patiently that
every one admired and praised him.</p>

<p>Do you think the people of Pennsylvania forget this great service?</p>

<p>&mdash;I wouldn't accuse them of being so ungrateful.</p>

<p>I suppose Garfield brought in another bill to dismiss him from the army
for not proclaiming martial law, doing the drum-head trial business, and
having a little human-target excursion every day?</p>

<p>&mdash;Come, come! Haven't you had enough of Garfield? Let me ask you one
more question. Which of the two do you think is going to be the next
President?</p>

<p>I know which of the two <i>ought</i> to be.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
